// Make it part of package "main".
package main

// Import GoLang's io.
import ("fmt")

// Main function.
func main() {
    // IO print string.
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!");
    alternateWelcome();
}

// Notes:
// Go doesn't exactly have classes, Go is a multi-paradigm prog lang.
// To make something that looks like a class, you can create a struct that
// you can then implement in function and later encapsulate withn a file
// and package.
